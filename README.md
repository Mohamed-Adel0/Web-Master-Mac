🏗️ Project Overview  
This project was designed and developed upon request from **Web-Master**, a company providing me with an **Internship** to enhance my practical web development skills. The project applies what I have learned during the internship, focusing on **HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS** to build a smooth and interactive user interface.  

✨ Features  
- **🔍 Search Functionality** – Enables users to quickly find menu items.  
- **🖼️ Select Image Feature** – Clicking a small image updates the large display image dynamically.  
- **🛒 Add to Cart** – Users can add items to their cart, with the total price updating automatically.  

🚀 Technologies Used  
- **HTML** – Structuring the webpage.  
- **JavaScript** – Implementing dynamic interactions.  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Styling the UI efficiently.  

This project is part of my **Internship** at **Web-Master**, where I strive to apply best practices in front-end development. Feel free to explore the code, and any feedback or contributions are welcome! 🚀
